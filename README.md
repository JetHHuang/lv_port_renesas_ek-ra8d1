# LVGL ported to Renesas EK-RA8D1

## Overview

The EK-RA8D1 evaluation kit enables users to effortlessly evaluate the features of the RA8D1 MCU Group and develop embedded systems applications using Renesas’ Flexible Software Package (FSP) and e2 studio IDE. Utilize rich on-board features along with your choice of popular ecosystem add-ons to bring your big ideas to life.

The MCU has a Cortex-M85 core which utilizes the Helium (SIMD) instruction set of Arm. Besides that the chip is equipped with a GPU (called DAVE2D) to off load the MCU. 

## Buy

You can purchase the Renesas EK-RA8D1 board from many distributors. See the sources at https://renesas.com/ek-ra8d1

## Benchmark

During the benchmark 2 frame buffer were used in the external SDRAM. LVGL was configured to `LV_DISPLAY_RENDER_MODE_DIRECT` and the buffer were swapped on VSYNC to avoid tearing.

As observed in the video, the FPS only drops in highly complex scenarios, while CPU usage remains low. For instance, when multiple ARGB images were rotated, the FPS dropped to 12 and the rendering time increased to 66 ms, but the CPU usage stayed at 10%. Using software rendering only the FPS would be significantly lower, and the CPU usage would peak at 100%.

## Getting started

### Hardware setup
- Attach the MIPI LCD PCB to the main PCB
- On SW1 DIP switched (middle of the board) 7 should be ON, all others are OFF
- Connect the USB cable to the `Debug1` (J10) connector

### Software setup
- Install the [JLink driver](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/) if not installed yet. 
- Install [Renesas E2 Studio](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/software-tool/e-studio)

### Run the project
- Clone this repository repository with submodules: `git clone https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_renesas_ek-ra8d1.git --recurse-submodules` (Downloading the `.zip` from GitHub doesn't work as it doesn't download the submodules)
- Import `lv_port_renesas_ek-ra8d1` in E2 Studio
- Build the project
- Click the Debug button. When prompted select the `J-Link ARM` Debugger and the `R7FA8D1BH` MCU

### Debugging
- Debug  `printf` output is via the Jlink VCOM port, 921600 8,n,1
